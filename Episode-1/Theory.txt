1. what is Emmet?
--> Emmet is a web development tool and abbreviation engine that helps web developers write
 HTML and CSS code more quickly and efficiently. It is often used as a plugin or integrated
 feature in code editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) such as Visual Studio Code,
  Sublime Text, and others.

2. Diff between Library and framework?
--> Library: A library is a collection of pre-written code and functions that developers can use 
in their own projects. Developers have control over when and how to use library functions.
Framework: A framework is a pre-designed structure that dictates the overall architecture and 
flow of an application. Developers build their code within the framework's constraints, 
following its rules and conventions.

3. Diff between Library and framework?
--> A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed globally to deliver 
web content faster and more reliably by caching and serving it from locations closer to end-users. 
We use CDNs to improve website performance, reduce latency, handle traffic spikes, 
and enhance overall user experience.

4. why React known as React?
--> React is called "React" because it is designed to efficiently update and "react" to 
changes in a web application's user interface, automatically updating the UI components when 
data or state changes occur.

5. what is cross-origin in the script tag?
--> In the context of a script tag, "cross-origin" refers to the situation where a web page tries to 
load a script file from a different domain (origin) than the one where the page itself is hosted. 
Browsers restrict such cross-origin script requests for security reasons, but you can enable them 
using mechanisms like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to specify which origins 
are allowed to access the script.

6. what is diff between React and ReactDom? 
--> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
ReactDOM is a specific package within React that provides methods for interacting with the DOM
(Document Object Model) and rendering React components into the web page.

7. what is diff between react.development.js and react.production.js file via CDN?
--> react.development.js is meant for development and debugging, providing extra error messages and 
warnings for developers. It is larger in size.
react.production.js is optimized for production use. It removes extra error messages and warnings,
resulting in a smaller file size, making it more suitable for live, performance-focused environments.

8. what is asyc and deffer? 
--> async loads and executes scripts asynchronously without waiting for HTML parsing,
while defer loads scripts asynchronously but ensures they are executed in order after HTML parsing 
is complete.
